# StepAhead
A student management website, focused on equity and career opportunities.

## Motivation
There is a negative correlation between students of lower household incomes and how well they do in school. The reasons are multifactoral, due in part to the fact that hard work doesn’t achieve everything--people need connections. On the flipside, companies want more qualified workers and students want opportunities in careers beyond secondary education. 

## Program
StepAhead ia a website that combines the aspects of student management with equitable showcasing of programs that are meant to highlight student merit and achivement to traditionally low-income households. Primarily aimed at guidance counselors, the website is comprised of tabs to access the program once signed in for a class.
